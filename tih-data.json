Mr. London has jammed books in every part of the hold not absolutely needed for other things and the titles of some of them would startle anyone less reckless than the author of the kind of stories that London not only writes but has lived. Among the volumes that show the most signs of use aboard the Snark are such as these: 'Tylor's Anthropology', 'Moulton's Introduction to Astrology, [...], and a host of others of a similar depth. There are all the standard books on travel and adventutres, including the seventeen volumes London has written himself, but no poetry. There is also a proof copy of London's latest book, which is not yet upon the market, 'The Iron Heel.'"},

            "text":"By Jack London. Author of 'Love of Life', 'Call of the Wild', etc. Published by Macmillan & Co., New York. Price $1.50. Seriously considered as a sociological study this Jack London book may be set down as pernicious, incendiary and nearly anarchistic. Otherwise it may seem even amusing - and London never meant it that way. He designedly offers in it no choice of emotions, but rather poses as the fanatic preaching the gospel of discontent and hatred. It is in purport a grim forecast and warning If we are not good see what will happen to us in 1932. In form the book is a manuscript, dated November 27, 419 B.O.M (One supposes the initials to signify Brotherhood of Man) written by the widow of a great socialist leader who had led one revolution and planned another. The manuscript tells of a fearful revolution that occurred in 1932, seven centuries earlier than the writer's period. The 'Iron Heel' is a tyrannical oligarchy which succeeded representative government; there is a sea of blood to wade through wherever you go in this book and much talk of the good times coming when socialism is the universal law and religion. But judging from this book that blessed state is as far from accomplishment then as now. Serious people will not think much of this work, but will admire its literary excellence."},

            "text":"The Iron Heel, the latest work of Jack London, the author of 'The Call of the Wild', 'The War of the Classes', etc., is a disappointment. As socialists and admirers of the young author we expected something better than the story given us in the Iron Heel. And we had a right to expect something better. It's true, Jack London, wrote a novel, and not a work of history. The novelist has certain liberties of using the varnish brush of fiction in picturing his story. But the author of The Iron Heel attempted to present a picture of the great social and labor war of the present day, and in this he failed, because his picture is not true. Instead of clearing the mind, he confuses. In the concluding chapters of his novel the author furnishes us with the proff that his conception of the modern labor and trades union movement is very defective He looks upon the labor movement through the pince-nez of the ultra-radical, Utopian socialist, which is not surprising in the least, for the reason that Jack London knows the trades union movement not from practical everyday experience, but from the columns of Utopian socialist newspapers. Jack London's latest work reflects the grave defect in the American socialist movement, a defect which requires a radical remedy. It is the Utopian conception of the socialist and trades union movement. Any man new in the socialist movement, having superficially read a five-cent pamphlet on socialism, unacquainted with the history and the mission of the movement, but calling himself a socialist, will assume the right to criticise, denounce and abuse any other man who may have spent a lifetime in the trades union movement. Although ignorant on the general labor problem, he considers himself superwise, because he has just taken out a socialist membership card, and he looks down with contempt on the 'masses of fools of union men' who fail to come up to his own intellectual standard. This un-socialistic spirit, which killed the S.L.P. and completely separated and isolated the DeLeonites from the general labor movement, is to some extent still alive in the Socialist Party, although it has never found any general official expression or recognition. It is the Super-Socialist, the SUper-Revolutionist, who is peeping out of every chapter of The Iron Heel. As a socialist novel the book is a failure. Nevertheless, we advise the socialists to read it, so they can convince themselves that even great authors may sometimes make serious blunders. The above is from the St. Louis socialist paper, one of the leading periodicals in the American socialist movement. It has become the fashion of the socialist press in this country to laud to the skies everythign that is put out by a socialist firm, or that has the name of a socialist attached to it, indiscriminately of its merit."},

            "text":"The Iron Heel. By Jack London. Mr. London is always interesting and alive, and the present book is no exception to the rule. Belonging as it does to his series of social studies, it succeeds in making very real a future state of society which, in the author's opinion, may be the outgrowth of modern political, economic and social conditions. The text of the story is supposed to have been a manuscript, discovered some centuries after it had been written and hidden, and describing the events of years of struggle between the classes dating from 1912 to 1932. During those years the leaders of the trusts have become transformed into oligachs; the middle classes have been destroyed, and there remain below the oligarchs, besides the socialists, only the tolling slaves of capital, the 'People of the Abyss'. Avis Everhard, the writer of the manuscript, is a woman of refinement, the daughter of a university professor, who, by reason of her love for a young socialist leader and her conversion to his doctrines, becomes identified with the party and ultimately gives up her life in its service. The rapid course of world development, which changes the world known to the readers of Mr. London's romance to the frightful scene of suffering and violence described in its pages, is detailed with such realism and force as to be thoroughly convincing. The book is a stirring narrative and also and essay in socialism calculated to make the thoughtful pause."},

If the authorities of Lawrence, Mass. could have invoked such a genteel and convenient instrument, why should they have descended to such clumsy weapons as the club and rifle? Strikers would naturally have resisted conscription compelling them (the very irony of it) to be traitors to their cause, to terrorize, manhandle, imprison and fire upon their fellow workmen, work-women, and workchildren. Ergo, mutiny, rebellion. Then a nice, quiet little drumhead court-martial by militia officers only and ye strikers would be quietly disposed of, with full sanction of Federal law. Jack London's 'The Iron Heel' (1908) is not only strangely prophetic of the Lawrence outrage, but the period covered by the book dates from 1912."},
